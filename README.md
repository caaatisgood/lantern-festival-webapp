#Lantern Festival Webapp Backend with Instagram API

A project of NYUST Hackathon (2016.06.29 - 2016.06.30)

## About
Use Instagram API to fetch photos with some official ` #HashTag ` and specific location of Lantern Festival. Display them on the official site to have futher interaction with users. We didn't submit for a client permission review of instagram. So we only fetch the data on our test account.

Here's the [frontend](https://github.com/guAnsunyata/yunlin-yuan-festival-ig-app) of our app made by [guAn](https://github.com/guAnsunyata).
